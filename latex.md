# LaTeX

## LaTeX for scientific writing and publication

LaTeX is a well-known system and set of software for preparing documents. It's designed to produce high quality documents and it gives a high degree of control over the process of creating the document.

## Installation in Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based distributions

To install LaTeX in an Ubuntu-based distribution, there's only one step that I took:

Open the terminal, and write:

````
$ apt install texlive-full
````

After that, I simply used Vim to write my whole dissertation.

## Installation in Windows

However, in order to learn, I also installed LaTeX in Windows. I'll include the steps soon.
