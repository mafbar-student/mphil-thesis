Below is the table of alternatives of common proprietary software that I use in research. At the moment, I use all software, including non-foss ones with the only exception being the open-source solar cell simulator PerovskiteSCModelling; haven't got around to it yet. Keep in mind that there are plenty of other alternatives available; these are just the ones that I use.
