# ChatGPT in Research

## ChatGPT

1. As you might know, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) is taking the world by storm. It is a large language model (LLM) made by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), which basically means that it is an AI model that is trained on large quantities of text data and is able to generate natural language.

2. Even thought ChatGPT is just a language model, it can generate and seemingly process all kinds of "prompts" or questions/requests that we have for it. It can generate pretty good texts and seemingly reason as well, because you can ask follow up questions and it can adjust to your inquiries, criticisms, and remarks. It also seemingly possess creativity as well, as it can generate different "ideas" or mix different prompts and produce a somewhat coherent text.

3. You can ask it all kinds of questions about all kinds of fields. It is trained on a _huge_ amount of data, up until a certain year (I think it's 2021 - all data that is fed into ChatGPT is only up to that point). You might notice though that for now, sometimes it gets some details wrong or let's say that you're an expert on a field. ChatGPT may not know the field as in-depth as you or may not have some intellectual insights on an expert level, but it is still pretty decent for the general public.

4. ChatGPT can also produce code. People, including me, use ChatGPT as a code assistant. You can prompt it to produce and adjust codes of almost all programming languages. It's imperfect for now, but you only need a little bit of adjustments before the code can work. With no professional background in programming, I'd say that it is almost as capable as producing simple codes as a junior developer or coder, provided you know how to prompt it. I've asked it ot produce C++, SQL, R, and Python code - and they all work well, if needing a little bit of an adjustment.

1. For my Master's, I didn't use ChatGPT. But I could envision using ChatGPT (or any other AI tools).
