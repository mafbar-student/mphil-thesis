Below is the list of software that I use in the completion of my dissertation so far. I try to use **free and open-source software (FOSS)** whenever I can, creating open-source workflows for graduate students. It is still incomplete at the moment, but I'm getting there. The ones with [x] are software that are not open-source that I currently use, though I do plan on removing them from my workflow.

### List of software:

- Microsoft Office [x]
- Mendeley [x]
- LibreOffice
- LaTeX
- Zotero
- Python
- Freeplane
- Qualcoder
- Visual Studio Code [x]
- Git
- Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) [x]
- Linux Mint (version 21)

[Mirosoft Office](https://www.office.com) is paired with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) is paired with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). Both pairs are effectively the same thing, though the latter are open-source, and I am just interested in how both sets will perform in the writing of college dissertations and academic journals. I am also currently writing my dissertation and journal paper in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) using the [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive) distribution alongside the [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) editor within [Linux Mint 21](https://linuxmint.com). So basically I am doing writing with three different software, and this is just an experiment to compare my own experiences in using Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and LaTeX to do academic writing. To get into a bit of detail, for LibreOffice at the moment, I use three programs under it, which are: Writer, Calc, and Math. Writer is like MS Office, and for me it works well for all my purposes. Math is kind of integrated into the whole LibreOffice suite, and so you can write advanced mathematical equations using Math in Writer. Aside from that, I also use Calc (counterpart to Excel) to store and graph out my simulation data. At the moment, I haven't properly learned LaTeX yet, though I intend to do so.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. I only use Python for the strict purpose of producing plots for my dissertation and publication. The package that I'm using is a very common data visualization tool, which is called [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I have tried several other plotting applications such as [LabPlot](https://labplot.kde.org/), [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/) and [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), and while they are all excellent plotting software that you should definitely try, I just find Python's matplotlib package to be the best in terms of intuitiveness, simplicity, elegance, and flexibility when making plots.

[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) is an open-source mind-mapping software, which is a fork of Freemind. Extremely useful in visualising concepts and making links between different sets of information. You can find the [documentation here](https://docs.freeplane.org/home.html) and its [Github page here](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane). Though those two are the official sources, I also found a [handbook published in Full Circle](https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437/thread/a85730a016/edb3/attachment/freeplane-handbook-fullcircle-parts-1-14.pdf), an Ubuntu magazine. It is slightly outdated though, since it is from Issue #130, which was published in February 2018 (this is written in 2022). I do use the latest version of Freemind though, and there is not that much difference from what I can tell, at least from my usage. Fortunately, except for a slight stumble in the beginning, this software is quite intuitive to use and I find the use to be more than enough for me. What helped me a lot were the documentation and also videos from Youtube. I encourage anyone curious in learning Freeplane to just watch Freeplane videos; there are lots that are instructive and some are honestly impressive.

[Qualcoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder) is an open-source computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Some prominent examples of CAQDAS are NVivo and MAXQDA. I use it to mainly do text coding. I should note that there are three main manuals that are good to refer to: (i) QC Developer's [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZDDwwRqb5qfihmhYPnR9GlM0XHMOpZXk) which consist of five videos made by the developer himself Colin Curtain, (ii) [a PDF manual](https://chainjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QualCoder_Manual.pdf), again written by himself, and (iii) a [usermanual.wiki page](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/QualCoderManual.312929938/help), though I strongly recommend the first two options.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VSCode for short is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. I use VSCode along with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage my mphil-thesis Github repository where I upload materials and resources related to my Master's research. Technically speaking, VSCode is not open-source, although the codebase is, as far as I know, identical to VSCodium with the exception of the addition of telemetry. I still use it due to its extremely common use at the moment.

[Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D)](https://scaps.elis.ugent.be) is a programme that can carry out one-dimensional solar cell simulations. Developed by Marc Burgelman, a professor at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Gent, Belgium. More information can be found on [scaps-1d.md](https://github.com/mafbar-student/mphil-thesis/blob/main/scaps-1d.md).

[Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) is a Linux operating system, a flavour of the very popular Ubuntu distribution. As for the moment, I only use Lubuntu 22.04.02 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) in a virtual machine, using Oracle VirtualBox. I want to explain two things: (i) why I pick Lubuntu, (ii) why I run it as a virtual machine. I picked Lubuntu because it is a flavour of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a mainstream, highly popular distribution with plenty of support from the community and resources available online. It's generally easier to use. In other words, it's made for someone like a me, a total beginner. Lots of packages, some come preinstalled, lots of resources online - if I look up a bug, usually there's a bunch of pages that address the bug in Ubuntu distributions. So, for a novice like me, it's quite easy to navigate using Lubuntu. I also picked Lubuntu because it's a lightweight distribution, owing to the fact that it uses the lightweight LXQT desktop. I would like to use GNOME, but it's a bit heavy for my comfort at the moment. Also, I use a virtual machine because it's easier for me to have a sandboxed Linux environment in which I can experiment with different software, different configurations perhaps, and generally it's a safe learning environment for me to get acquainted with Linux. It's easier to create snapshots, it's portable, it's safe, it's fun - it's all really good for my purpose. I also have LaTeX there, for the purposes of publication.
