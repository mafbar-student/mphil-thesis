Below is the list of software that I use in the completion of my dissertation so far. I try to use **free and open-source software (FOSS)** whenever I can, creating open-source workflows for graduate students. It is still incomplete at the moment, but I'm getting there. The ones with [x] are software that are not open-source that I currently use, though I do plan on removing them from my workflow.

## List of software:

- Microsoft Office [x]
- Mendeley [x]
- LibreOffice
- Zotero
- Freeplane
- Qualcoder
- Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D)

___

[Mirosoft Office](https://www.office.com) is paired with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) is paired with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). Both pairs are effectively the same thing, though the latter are open-source, and I am just interested in how both sets will perform in the writing of college dissertations. I will soon use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) or [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and Zotero to replace Microsoft Word and Mendeley entirely.

[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) is an open-source mind-mapping software, which is a fork of Freemind. Extremely useful in visualising concepts and making links between different sets of information.

[Qualcoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder) is a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Some prominent examples of CAQDAS are NVivo and MAXQDA. I use it to mainly do text coding.

[Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D)](https://scaps.elis.ugent.be) is a programme that can carry out one-dimensional solar cell simulations. Developed by Marc Burgelman, a professor at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Gent, Belgium.
