Below is the list of software that I use in the completion of my dissertation so far. I try to use **free and open-source software (FOSS)** whenever I can, creating open-source workflows for graduate students. It is still incomplete at the moment, but I'm getting there. The ones with [x] are software that are not open-source that I currently use, though I do plan on removing them from my workflow.

### List of software:

- Microsoft Office [x]
- Mendeley [x]
- LibreOffice
- LaTeX
- Zotero
- Python (matplotlib)
- Freeplane
- Qualcoder
- Visual Studio Code [x]
- Git
- Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) [x]
- Linux Mint (version 21)

[Mirosoft Office](https://www.office.com) is paired with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) is paired with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). Both pairs are effectively the same thing, though the latter are open-source, and I am just interested in how both sets will perform in the writing of college dissertations and academic journals. I am also currently writing my dissertation and journal paper in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) using the [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive) distribution alongside the [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) editor within [Linux Mint 21](https://linuxmint.com). 

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. I only use Python for the strict purpose of producing plots for my dissertation and publication. The package that I'm using is a very common data visualization tool, which is called [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I have tried several other plotting applications such as [LabPlot](https://labplot.kde.org/), [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/) and [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), and while they are all excellent plotting software that you should definitely try, I just find Python's matplotlib package to be the best in terms of intuitiveness, simplicity, elegance, and flexibility when making plots.

[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) is an open-source mind-mapping software, which is a fork of Freemind. Extremely useful in visualising concepts and making links between different sets of information. You can find the [documentation here](https://docs.freeplane.org/home.html) and its [Github page here](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane). Though those two are the official sources, I also found a [handbook published in Full Circle](https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437/thread/a85730a016/edb3/attachment/freeplane-handbook-fullcircle-parts-1-14.pdf), an Ubuntu magazine. It is slightly outdated though, since it is from Issue #130, which was published in February 2018 (this is written in 2022). I do use the latest version of Freemind though, and there is not that much difference from what I can tell, at least from my usage. Fortunately, except for a slight stumble in the beginning, this software is quite intuitive to use and I find the use to be more than enough for me. What helped me a lot were the documentation and also videos from Youtube. I encourage anyone curious in learning Freeplane to just watch Freeplane videos; there are lots that are instructive and some are honestly impressive.

[Qualcoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder) is an open-source computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Some prominent examples of CAQDAS are NVivo and MAXQDA. I use it to mainly do text coding. I should note that there are three main manuals that are good to refer to: (i) QC Developer's [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZDDwwRqb5qfihmhYPnR9GlM0XHMOpZXk) which consist of five videos made by the developer himself Colin Curtain, (ii) [a PDF manual](https://chainjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QualCoder_Manual.pdf), again written by himself, and (iii) a [usermanual.wiki page](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/QualCoderManual.312929938/help), though I strongly recommend the first two options.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VSCode for short is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. I use VSCode along with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage my mphil-thesis Github repository where I upload materials and resources related to my Master's research. Technically speaking, VSCode is not open-source, although the codebase is, as far as I know, identical to VSCodium with the exception of the addition of telemetry. I still use it due to its prevalence at the moment.

[Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D)](https://scaps.elis.ugent.be) is a programme that can carry out one-dimensional solar cell simulations. Developed by Marc Burgelman, a professor at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Gent, Belgium. More information can be found on [scaps-1d.md](https://github.com/mafbar-student/mphil-thesis/blob/main/scaps-1d.md).
