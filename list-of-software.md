Below is the list of software that I use in the completion of my dissertation so far. I try to use **free and open-source software (FOSS)** whenever I can, creating open-source workflows for graduate students. It is still incomplete at the moment, but I'm getting there. The ones with [x] are software that are not open-source that I currently use, though I do plan on removing them from my workflow.

### List of software:

- Microsoft Office [x]
- Mendeley [x]
- LibreOffice
- Zotero
- Freeplane
- Qualcoder
- Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) [x]

[Mirosoft Office](https://www.office.com) is paired with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) is paired with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). Both pairs are effectively the same thing, though the latter are open-source, and I am just interested in how both sets will perform in the writing of college dissertations. I will soon use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) or [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and Zotero to replace Microsoft Word and Mendeley entirely.

[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) is an open-source mind-mapping software, which is a fork of Freemind. Extremely useful in visualising concepts and making links between different sets of information. You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.freeplane.org/home.html) and its [Github page here](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane). Though those two are the official sources, I also found a [handbook published in Full Circle](https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437/thread/a85730a016/edb3/attachment/freeplane-handbook-fullcircle-parts-1-14.pdf), an Ubuntu magazine. It is slightly outdated though, since it is from Issue #130, which was published in February 2018 (this is written in 2022). I do use the latest version of Freemind though, and there is not that much difference from what I can tell, at least from my usage. Fortunately, except for a slight stumble in the beginning, this software is quite intuitive to use and I find the use to be more than enough for me. What helped me a lot were the documentation and also videos from Youtube. I encourage anyone curious in learning Freeplane to just watch Freeplane videos; there are lots that are instructive and some are honestly impressive.

[Qualcoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder) is an open-source computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Some prominent examples of CAQDAS are NVivo and MAXQDA. I use it to mainly do text coding. I should note that there are three main manuals that are good to refer to: (i) QC Developer's [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZDDwwRqb5qfihmhYPnR9GlM0XHMOpZXk) which consist of five videos made by the developer himself Colin Curtain, (ii) [a PDF manual](https://chainjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QualCoder_Manual.pdf), again written by himself, and (iii) a [usermanual.wiki page](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/QualCoderManual.312929938/help), though I strongly recommend the first two options.

[Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D)](https://scaps.elis.ugent.be) is a programme that can carry out one-dimensional solar cell simulations. Developed by Marc Burgelman, a professor at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Gent, Belgium. More information can be found on [scaps-1d.md](https://github.com/mafbar-student/mphil-thesis/blob/main/scaps-1d.md).
