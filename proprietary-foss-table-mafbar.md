Below is the table of alternatives of common proprietary software that I use in research. This is a simple comparison table of proprietary and free and open-source software. Keep in mind that there are plenty of other alternatives available; these are just ones that are particularly relevant to my own workflow. However, to see the list of software that I use, read [here](https://github.com/mafbar-student/mphil-thesis/blob/main/list-of-software.md).
