# Free and open-source software (FOSS) for research

## Personal experience

I am a graduate student in Malaysia, doing research on solar cells. In Malaysia, it has been my experience that it is very rare to see students using a Linux operating system and knowingly using open-source software. A large majority of people use Windows, macOS, proprietary software or some version of freemium or freeware software. In my experience, when people use open-source software, it is due to the fact that it's costless, and therefore convenient. This is not an attack against proprietary software or people, by the way. This is a mere observation. In fact, I would say that I used proprietary software too and still do.

During my bachelor's degree, I tried using open-source software as integral parts of my workflow to complete my undergraduate dissertation, and it was quite successful. I used the MX Linux distribution (though any distribution would suffice), I used LibreOffice Writer and Zotero to write my dissertation and manage my references (in hindsight I should have probably used LaTeX but I'm getting ahead of myself), I used LibreOffice Calc to visualise numerical data, I used a Python programme called TanabeSugano on Github and Fityk for a numerical and analytical works. There was one proprietary software that I had to use which was OriginPro, and that was because using the open-source version (Fityk is the open-source counterpart) was insufficient for my specific purpose at that moment.

There was also a subject called *Fizik Komputasi* (English: Computational Physics), where we had to use MATLAB to learn some basic scientific and mathematical programming. And while I did use MATLAB, I also used GNU Octave, which is basically a clone of MATLAB. It is mostly compatible with MATLAB and if you were to use GNU Octave to learn this course, it wouldn't make much of a difference. Every code that I ran on MATLAB, I was able to run on Octave with practically identical results.
