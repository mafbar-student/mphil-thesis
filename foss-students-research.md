# Free and open-source software (FOSS) for students and researchers

## Personal experience

I am a graduate student in Malaysia, doing research on solar cells. In Malaysia, it has been my experience that it is very rare to see students using a Linux operating system and knowingly using free and open-source software (FOSS). A large majority of people use Windows, macOS, proprietary software or some version of freemium or freeware software. In my experience, when people use open-source software, it is due to the fact that it's costless, and therefore convenient. This is not an attack against proprietary software or people, by the way. This is a mere observation. In fact, I would say that I used proprietary software too and still do.

During my bachelor's degree, I tried using open-source software as integral parts of my workflow to complete my undergraduate dissertation, and it was quite successful. I used the MX Linux distribution (though any distribution would suffice), I used LibreOffice Writer and Zotero to write my dissertation and manage my references (in hindsight I should have probably used LaTeX but I'm getting ahead of myself), I used LibreOffice Calc to visualise numerical data, I used a Python programme called TanabeSugano on Github and Fityk for a numerical and analytical works. There was one proprietary software that I had to use which was OriginPro, and that was because using the open-source version (Fityk is the open-source counterpart) was insufficient for my specific purpose at that moment.

There was also a subject called *Fizik Komputasi* (English: Computational Physics), where we had to use MATLAB to learn some basic scientific and mathematical programming. And while I did use MATLAB, I also used GNU Octave, which is basically a clone of MATLAB. It is mostly compatible with MATLAB and if you were to use GNU Octave to learn this course, it wouldn't make much of a difference. Every code that I ran on MATLAB, I was able to run on Octave with practically identical results. This made me think about having entirely or almost entirely free and open-source software as a student.

This might sound strange to students in other parts of the world. In that, it seems that I make using FOSS out to be some kind of strange endeavour. I imagine that for academic documents, LaTeX is pretty common at universities throughout the world. For some reason, LaTeX was never mentioned to me at university by anyone except for one lecturer who said that they wasn't familiar with how to use it. Everybody used Microsoft Office to write dissertations. And from my understanding, LaTeX is heavily used in scientific and mathematical fields. I was a physics student. "But hey," I thought, "maybe it is used in postgraduate more?" but it was not the case too, at least not for me. I am also not using LaTeX as I am currently doing my Masters.

When I read up online, it seems that students all over the world use LaTeX. Now, this is not an essay about LaTeX, but rather just a specific example of the dependence on proprietary software (e.g. MS Office, MATLAB) to do academic works, *especially* undergraduate works.
