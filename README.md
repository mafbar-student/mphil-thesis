# mphil-thesis

A repository of materials and resources related to my Master of Philosophy (Science) experience at Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. In here, I will put various links, notes, writings, thoughts, ideas, etc. that I find useful in my specific research and research in general. In a way, this is a journal of some sort documenting my research experience, especially from a technical standpoint.
