# SCAPS-1D

[SCAPS-1D](https://scaps.elis.ugent.be) or SCAPS for short which stands for Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) is a programme that can carry out one-dimensional solar cell simulations. It was developed by Marc Burgelman, a professor at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Gent, Belgium. All the details of the software can be found in the website. As of writing, the latest version is 3.3.10, and that is the version that I used in this research.

It is a competent simulation software with multiple features and has been employed many times in the field of solar cell research. Searching up the software on Google Scholar will turn up roughly 5000 papers. Originally, the software is used for only a few types of solar cells:

> The (sic) was originally programme is developed for cell structures of the CuInSe2 and the CdTe family. Recent developments make the programme now also applicable to crystalline solar cells (Si and GaAs family) and amorphous cells (a-Si and micromorphous Si).

But it has since been used for many different kinds of solar cells. For example, I use it to simulate perovskite solar cells (PSCs), to varying degrees of success. Because of the numerical approach towards simulation, you can simulate pretty much any kind of solar cell (as long as you restrict it to one-dimensional structures) as long as you have each layer's parameters and values, which you can glean from the literature and experimentation. So here I will demonstrate some basic functions of the software, which you can learn from and pretty much conduct your own simulations. This is basically all I have done for the entirety of my research. If you learn what I wrote here, then you can do your own research too.
